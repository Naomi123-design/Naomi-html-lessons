            Waste disposal refers to the methods used to manage and remove unwanted materials. These methods can include
            landfilling, incineration, recycling, composting, and various other techniques. Landfills are the most common, while
            incineration and recycling offer alternatives that can also reduce waste volume and generate energy.
            Common Waste Disposal Methods:
            Landfilling:
            This involves burying waste in a designated area, often covered with layers of soil to prevent contamination and odors.
            Incineration:
            Waste is burned at high temperatures, reducing its volume and potentially recovering energy in the process.
            Recycling:
            Materials are collected and processed to create new products, conserving resources and reducing landfill waste.
