        <p>
            A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning environments and teaching for students, typically
            under the direction of teachers. It's a place where students acquire knowledge, skills, values, and morals, developing
            into well-rounded individuals. Schools play a vital role in shaping society by preparing students for their future roles
            and contributing to social development.
